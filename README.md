A program has been developed that simulates the k-means clustering algorithm.
The initial data is an image containing objects of different colors on a single-color background.
The program must implement the following procedures with the output of the result on the screen:

– image loading;

– manual assignment of the number of clusters k (the number of clusters is determined by the teacher);

– implementation of the k-means algorithm, where the R, G, B pixel values ​​are used as features; the result is a mask image containing k colors corresponding to the formed clusters.
